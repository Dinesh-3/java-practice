/**
 * What is Design Pattern ?
 *  Design patterns are well tested patterns for some common problems
 *  To design reusable and extensible Object-Oriented software
 *  Docs: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/design_pattern_overview.htm
 *  Types:
 *      1. Creational -> Different ways to create an object
 *      2. Structural -> Relationship between the objects
 *      3. Behavioural -> Interaction or communication between the objects
 *      4. J2EE Pattern
 *  BOOK -> Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software By GOF (Gang Of Four)

 LLM PROMPT

 You are a senior software architect with 10+ years of experience at big tech companies. Explain the [DESIGN_PATTERN_NAME] design pattern using this exact structure:

 ## INTRODUCTION
 - Start with a single sentence defining what the pattern does in practical terms
 - Explain the core problem it solves in 2-3 sentences

 ## CORE COMPONENTS & STRUCTURE
 - List the key participants/roles (e.g., Subject, Observer, ConcreteSubject)
 - Explain how they interact in 3-4 bullet points
 - Include UML relationship types where relevant (association, composition, etc.)

 ## WHEN TO USE
 - 3-4 specific scenarios where this pattern is ideal
 - Include business requirements context (e.g., "Product Owner says...")
 - Mention technical constraints that make it necessary

 ## WHEN NOT TO USE
 - 2-3 situations where other patterns or approaches are better
 - Include performance, complexity, or scale considerations
 - Suggest alternatives briefly

 ## BIG TECH REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
 - Provide 2-3 examples from companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon
 - Focus on internal systems, not obvious examples like notifications
 - Explain WHY they chose this pattern over alternatives
 - Include framework internals (Spring, React, Android, etc.)

 ## PRACTICAL BUSINESS USE CASES
 - 3-4 scenarios a software engineer would encounter from Product Owners
 - Frame as user stories: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
 - Show how the pattern addresses these requirements
 - Include compliance, analytics, monitoring use cases

 ## JAVA IMPLEMENTATION
 - Provide complete, production-ready code example (not toy examples)
 - Use interfaces, concrete classes, and proper Java conventions
 - Include error handling and thread safety considerations where relevant
 - Show both the pattern structure and usage/demo code
 - Add comments explaining business logic, not just technical details

 ## IMPLEMENTATION TIPS
 - 3-4 practical tips for production use
 - Include performance optimizations
 - Mention memory management (avoiding leaks, cleanup)
 - Threading/concurrency considerations
 - Integration with existing frameworks

 ## BUSINESS VALUE
 - Explain benefits in terms management understands
 - Mention maintainability, scalability, team productivity
 - Include how it enables faster feature development
 - Reference reduced coupling, testing improvements

 ## COMMON PITFALLS
 - 2-3 mistakes developers commonly make
 - Include debugging/troubleshooting guidance
 - Memory leaks, performance issues, over-engineering warnings

 ## VARIATIONS & RELATED PATTERNS
 - Mention 1-2 related patterns and how they differ
 - Show when to combine patterns
 - Reference Gang of Four classification if relevant

 FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
 - Use ### for main section headers
 - Include code blocks with proper Java syntax
 - Write in active voice, be concise but comprehensive
 - Target 800-1200 words total
 - Assume the reader is a mid-level software engineer preparing for interviews or implementing production systems

 Do not include generic textbook examples. Focus on practical, real-world scenarios that a software engineer would actually encounter and implement.

 Now explain the [DESIGN_PATTERN_NAME] design pattern following this structure.
